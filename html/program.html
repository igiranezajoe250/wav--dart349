            <h1>Open-Akademy statement</h1><br><br><br>
            Our mission at Open Akademy is to advance human fellowship through conversations.<br> 
            We aim to bring students together to a back-and-forth talk on topics that matter to them. 
            We hope this will contribute to innovation and clear perspectives. 
   
          <p> We are aiming at building a space where ideas are praticed. Frequently, education is seen as the path to learn and work as the way to put in pratice what you've learn. 
            <br> However, this understanding doesn't match today's world. Education doesn't have to be separated from pratice and because of the access to education the work market need early talents <br>
            The gap use to have a role and meaning but now this gap would cost more than what we can benefit from. We are losing by not adapting the proper way of working and learning. <br>
            <br> However, Roma was not build in one day, while this is the reminder it should not serve as an excuse or talking point of not doing what should be done in due time.
            Currently, Young people can start to solve and contribute after learning basic years of education. Which means, not knowledge is no longer heald in desinated education institute. Nor is not only collected by designeted people.<br><br><br>
            Now people working in the industry has more experience and knowledge to share more than the designeted institutes. <br.<br>
            For this not becoming a problem we need two things first having an easier way to document what we do daily this would help to realize the dream of sharing from experience. Second, Sharing should be centered locally or micro level. <br>
            Because education is not only to share information there is also the fact of mentorship being with others. learn from seeing. For fast and effective education you have to be with someone to speed the starting. Therefore, being local is <br>
            crusial and it a must for a suistanable universal education. However, this does take aware the capacity of global network, connecting and accessing without limit. 
            <br><br><br> When all of this is done, we also need to develop tools and framework that would be used. <br>
            In the developement of this platform we should take advantage of that we are building something new. And this approach would help us think through man ascpet before or while developing. <br>
            Another ascpet of benefiting is to be able to operate and work not out off pressure or fear. We should try not to build system that are agaist any idea instead, it should be more of what that the system needs to do.<br>
            The benefit of starting early and starting where you should start benefites us to be able to build micro components that will eventually become part of a bigger channel. Plus, we have time to text and try out what work and what does not work. <br>
            We also get the time to see the effects and casual effects which the system comes with. And we can continuelly keep building tools that are useful, realiable and suistanable.           </p>
